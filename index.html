			<h1>Epic Farm <small>CMSC425 Spring 2013</small></h1>

			<div id="EpicFarm">Please enable Javascript.</div>

			<p>Epic Farm was developed in Actionscript 3.0 and compiled using the Adobe Flex compiler.</p>

			<h4>Highlights</h4>
			<p>
			I developed a custom isometric engine for this game.<br/>
			This involved writing a set of functions to translate between the screen coordinate system and the isometric coordinate system.<br/>
			A notable feature is the collision-detection routine that I created to check for overlaps in isometric space.<br/>
			Another aspect of my isometric engine is the depth-sorting function that ensures that all objects are drawn on the screen in the correct order, depending on their isometric coordinates.</br>
			</p>

			<p>
			I also developed a system for panning and zooming in the viewport.<br/>
			My zoom function compensates for any panning that the player has done, so that the zoom is always relative to the center of the viewport.<br/>
			</p>

			<p>
			I created a UI overlay for the game, including a store where the player can buy crops, score and resource displays, and buttons to access the various features of the game.<br/>
			The resource displays are dynamic and will gradually increment and decrement whenever there is a change in the resource values.<br/>
			</p>

			<h4>Libraries</h4>

			<p>
			The program uses the Adobe Flex SDK to provide the core Actionscript API.<br/>
